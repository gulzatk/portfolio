             <p>I have a beachelor degree in Public Relations. During the last two days in the university I worked as a journalist. After came to US I thought to change my career. Tried a lot of things like a hair master, daycare teacher, customer service. Then my husband (who is a software engineer) recommended me to try programming. I liked coding and now I am here, in Epicodus.</p>
